# Feature-Reduction-Using-IRIS-Flower-Analysis-and-PCA


ğŸ“Œ Each dataset can have more than one feature. In machine learning, this is called dimension.

ğŸ“Œ With PCA, we aim to make multidimensional datasets less dimensional without losing the meaning of the dataset.

ğŸ“Œ We use multidimensional datasets to easily visualize them.

ğŸ“Œ We can easily see and understand 2D or 3D data that can be seen with the human eye.

ğŸ“Œ We use it to compress data.

ğŸ“Œ During this process, more than 90% of the variance is preserved. So the loss is minimal.

ğŸ“Œ Used in data and photo compression.

ğŸ“Œ In the face recognition process, this process is applied first and the distinctive features of the human face are obtained.
